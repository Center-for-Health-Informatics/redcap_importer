1. Download RedcapImorter, put it on your Python path and add it to settings.INSTALLED_APPS.

2. Add to your project urls

	path('redcap_importer/', include(('redcap_importer.urls', 'redcap_importer'), namespace='redcap_importer')),

3. Create an app for each REDCap project you will connect to. You might want to identify this app with a name extension like '_staging'

	python manage.py startapp ciclr_staging
	# add to settings.INSTALLED_APPS

4. You might want to separate application/patient data into different databases. See router_example.py for example code.

5. Create a new REDCap Connection record

	API URL: https://redcap.research.cchmc.org/api/
	API Token: In REDCap click on Applications-> API in menu
	primary_key_field: this will be the name of the very first field when you download the DD
		- TODO: this value could be automatically grabbed
	
6. python manage.py redcap_get_dd myconn				# populates the other redcap_importer tables

7. python manage.py redcap_write_model myconn 		# outputs the model classes

	- save this output string to myapp/models.py
	- once you've done this, you should be able to view the redcap structure on the website
	
8. make sure there are no migrations for your app, and you can run this to get syncdb functionality

	python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb --database=cicrl
	
9. python manage.py redcap_load_data myconn
