May need to modify DD and models if:
- my code changes
- the REDCap database changes


If you're not using migrations for your app, you need to delete all tables in the database and start over.

Example in MySQL:
DROP DATABASE cicrl;
CREATE DATABASE cicrl CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
GRANT ALL ON cicrl.* TO 'redcap_to_db_site'@'localhost';

Then rerun installing instructions from step 6
